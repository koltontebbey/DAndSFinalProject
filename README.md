# Oconee County Fire Rescue (OCFR) POC Application
## Copyright 2020, Big Brain Consulting & Company.
Currently, the Oconee County Fire Rescue lacks an efficient way of tracking certifications for their current and former members. Our desired outcomes would be 1) Track current and former employees along with their respective certifications
2) Display this information through a running web application on the cloud
3) Make the application simple, and user friendly
